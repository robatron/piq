# PIQ: Programming Interview Questions

My personal selection of software engineering interview questions and solutions for using in, and practicing for, software engineering interviews.

All solutions are written in TypeScript mainly because I think the tooling, especially the test tooling, is excellent, and allow for rapid development and iteration.

There will likely be multiple solutions for each question; These solutions are just what I came up with.

## Collections

Programming problems are broken down into several sections.

## Todo

-   Add a new TypeScript language to https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition ? Doesn't seem maintained.
