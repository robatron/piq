/**
 * Given a grid with different colors in a different cell, each color
 * represented by a different number. The task is to find out the largest
 * connected component on the grid. Largest component grid refers to a maximum
 * set of cells such that you can move from any cell to any other cell in this
 * set by only moving between side-adjacent cells from the set.
 *
 * Note: Read that this question was asked in a Microsoft interview. Problem
