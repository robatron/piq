# PIQ: Programming Interview Questions

My personal selection of software engineering interview questions and solutions for using in, and practicing for, software engineering interviews.

All solutions are written in TypeScript and intentionally ignore language features to make the solutions more "C-like" to fit with the spirit of the questions. (E.g., not using `Array.prototype.reverse()` when asked to reverse an array.) I chose TypeScript because I can use most of the JavaScript dev tooling, (which I think is excellent, especially the test tooling,) and adds typing which JS sorely needs.

Programming problems and solutions are organized by collection:

-   `src/ctci-6th-ed/`: Exercises from [_Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition_](https://smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- (More coming soon?)

## Usage

All exercises are implemented as tests. Simply run `npm test` to run them.

## Todo

-   Add a new TypeScript language to https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition ? Doesn't seem maintained.
