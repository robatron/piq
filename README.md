# PIQ: Programming Interview Questions

My personal collection of software engineering interview questions and solutions for use and practice in software engineering interviews.

All solutions are written in TypeScript and **often intentionally ignore language features** to fit with the spirit of the questions, improve efficiency, or just to add additional challenge, e.g., not using `Array.prototype.reverse()` when asked to reverse an array. I chose TypeScript because I can use most of the JavaScript dev tooling, (which I think is excellent, especially the test tooling,) and adds typing which JS sorely needs.

Programming exercises and solutions are organized by collection under `src/`:

-   `codesignal/`: [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/interview-practice/) interview practice exercises
-   `ctci-6th-ed/`: Exercises from the [_Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition_](https://smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/) book
-   `interview-cake/`: Exercises from the [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) course (highly recommended!)
-   `leetcode/`: Exercises from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
-   `misc/`: Random coding exercises, algorithms, and data structures

## Usage

All exercises are implemented as tests. Simply run `npm test` to run all of them once, or run `npm start` to start watching for changed files and rerunning related tests.
