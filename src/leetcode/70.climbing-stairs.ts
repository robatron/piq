 * [70] Climbing Stairs
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/
 *
 * Easy (50.00%)
 *
 * You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
 *
 * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can
 * you climb to the top?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * - Input: n = 2
 * - Output: 2
 * - Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top:
 *   - 1. 1 step + 1 step
 *   - 2. 2 steps
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * - Input: n = 3
 * - Output: 3
 * - Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
 *   - 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 *   - 2. 1 step + 2 steps
 *   - 3. 2 steps + 1 step
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * - Input: n = 4
 * - Output: 5
 * - Explaination: There are five ways to climb to the top.
 *   - 1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
 *   - 2. 1 + 1 + 2
 *   - 3. 1 + 2 + 1
 *   - 4. 2 + 1 + 1
 *   - 5. 2 + 2
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * - 1 <= n <= 45
