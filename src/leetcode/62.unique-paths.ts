 *
 * [62] Unique Paths
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/
 *
 * Medium (58.58%)
 *
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the
 * top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the
 * bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move
 * either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths
 * that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to
 * 2 * 10^9.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * - Input: m = 3, n = 7
 * - Output: 28
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * - Input: m = 3, n = 2
 * - Output: 3
 * - Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach
 *   the bottom-right corner:
 *   1. Right -> Down -> Down
 *   2. Down -> Down -> Right
 *   3. Down -> Right -> Down
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 100

// @lc code=start

/**
 * Dynamic programming (bottom up). Track number of ways to get to each position
 * which are just the number of ways to get to the position above plus the
 * number of ways to get to the position to the left (b/c the only ways to get
 * to the current position are by moving down or moving right).
 *
 * - Base case: The number of ways to get to the top-left column is 1 b/c we're
 *   already there!
 *
 * - Edge cases: The number of ways to get to any position in the row above the
 *   topmost row is 0, as is the number of ways to get to any position to the
 *   left of the leftmost column. (B/c those positions don't exist.)
 *
 * - Time: O(m*n) b/c visit every position once
 * - Space: O(m*n) b/c we track the number of ways to get to every position (we
 *   can probably improve this b/c there are a fixed number of previous
 *   positions we reference in the recurrance relation)
 *
 * Done in 15 mins, LC submission accepted first try ðŸ˜Š
 *
 * - Your runtime beats 86.03 % of typescript submissions
 * - Your memory usage beats 7.94 % of typescript submissions (41.4 MB)
 *
 * @todo: Optimize space. Don't need to track number of ways to get to every
 * position just the space above and left of the current position.
